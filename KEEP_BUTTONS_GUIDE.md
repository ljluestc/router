# Keep Buttons Auto-Click Guide

## üéØ Overview

The auto-accept script now includes full support for **Keep** and **Keep All** buttons, in addition to the existing Accept, Run, Apply, Execute, Resume, and Try Again buttons.

## ‚úÖ What's Implemented

### 1. Button Detection
- **Keep**: Detects buttons containing "Keep" text
- **Keep All**: Detects buttons containing "Keep All" text
- Works in both **Cursor** and **Windsurf** IDEs
- Automatically enabled by default

### 2. Configuration
- Toggle Keep buttons on/off in the control panel
- Individual control for "Keep" and "Keep All" buttons
- Persistent settings saved to localStorage

### 3. Analytics & Tracking
- Tracks Keep button clicks in analytics
- Calculates time savings for Keep actions
- Shows Keep button usage in the Analytics tab
- Exports Keep button data with other analytics

## üöÄ How to Use

### Basic Usage
1. Load the script in your IDE
2. The control panel will appear automatically
3. Click "Start" to begin auto-clicking
4. Keep buttons will be automatically clicked along with other buttons

### Testing Keep Buttons
```javascript
// Test Keep button detection
testKeepButtons()

// Enable debug mode to see detailed logging
enableDebug()

// Check current status
acceptStatus()
```

### Configuration
```javascript
// Enable only Keep buttons
enableOnly(['keep', 'keepAll'])

// Disable Keep buttons
disableButton('keep')
disableButton('keepAll')

// Re-enable Keep buttons
enableButton('keep')
enableButton('keepAll')
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If Keep Buttons Aren't Being Clicked

1. **Check Button Text**: Ensure buttons contain "Keep" or "Keep All" text
2. **Enable Debug Mode**: Run `enableDebug()` to see detailed logging
3. **Test Detection**: Run `testKeepButtons()` to see what buttons are found
4. **Check Configuration**: Verify Keep buttons are enabled in the control panel

### Debug Commands
```javascript
// Enable detailed logging
enableDebug()

// Test Keep button detection
testKeepButtons()

// Check all found buttons
debugAccept()

// View analytics
showAnalytics()
```

## üìä Analytics

Keep button clicks are tracked in:
- **File Analytics**: Shows which files had Keep actions
- **Button Type Counts**: Shows how many Keep clicks occurred
- **Time Savings**: Calculates time saved by auto-clicking Keep buttons
- **Session Data**: Tracks Keep actions over time

## üéõÔ∏è Control Panel

The control panel includes:
- **Keep** checkbox: Enable/disable individual Keep buttons
- **Keep All** checkbox: Enable/disable Keep All buttons
- **Analytics Tab**: View Keep button usage statistics
- **ROI Tab**: See time savings from Keep button automation

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Time Savings Calculation
- **Keep**: Standard workflow time (30 seconds saved per click)
- **Keep All**: Standard workflow + 5 seconds (35 seconds saved per click)

### Custom Workflow Times
```javascript
// Adjust workflow timing (manual seconds, automated milliseconds)
calibrateWorkflow(25, 100) // 25 seconds manual, 100ms automated
```

## üìù Example Usage

```javascript
// Start auto-accepting all buttons including Keep
startAccept()

// Check what buttons are being detected
testKeepButtons()

// View analytics to see Keep button usage
showAnalytics()

// Stop auto-accepting
stopAccept()
```

## üêõ Common Issues

1. **Buttons not detected**: Check if they contain exact "Keep" text
2. **Script not running**: Ensure you've called `startAccept()`
3. **No analytics**: Keep buttons are tracked in the Analytics tab
4. **IDE detection issues**: Script auto-detects Cursor vs Windsurf

## üìà Benefits

- **Time Savings**: Automatically click Keep buttons without manual intervention
- **Consistency**: Ensures all Keep actions are processed
- **Analytics**: Track how often Keep buttons are used
- **Productivity**: Focus on coding while script handles UI interactions

The Keep button functionality is now fully integrated and ready to use!
