- `enableKeep: true` - Enable Keep buttons
- Both options are in the control panel UI

- **Cursor IDE**: `'keep all'` and `'keep'` patterns added to main detection
- **Windsurf IDE**: `'keep all'` and `'keep'` patterns added to Windsurf detection
- **Debug patterns**: `'keep'` added to debug search patterns

### 3. Button Type Normalization
- `'keep all'` ‚Üí `'keep-all'`
- `'keep'` ‚Üí `'keep'`

### 4. Time Savings Calculation
- `'keep all'`: `averageCompleteWorkflow + 5000ms` (extra time to review all changes)
- `'keep'`: `averageCompleteWorkflow` (standard workflow time)

### 5. Configuration Panel
- Checkboxes for "Keep" and "Keep All" buttons
- Proper event handling and config mapping

### 6. Help Text

## üîç Current Status

The Keep button functionality is **fully implemented** and should work automatically. The script will:

1. **Detect** Keep and Keep All buttons in both Cursor and Windsurf IDEs
2. **Click** them automatically when the script is running
3. **Track** them in analytics with proper time savings calculation
4. **Log** the actions in the control panel

## üß™ Testing

To test the Keep buttons:

1. Open `test_keep_buttons.html` in a browser
2. Click "Start Auto-Accept" 
3. Click the "Keep" or "Keep All" test buttons
4. The script should automatically detect and log the clicks
5. Check the Analytics tab to see the tracked data

## üêõ Potential Issues

If Keep buttons are not being detected, check:

1. **Button text**: Ensure the actual buttons contain "Keep" or "Keep All" text
2. **Button visibility**: Buttons must be visible and clickable
3. **IDE detection**: Make sure the correct IDE is detected
4. **Debug mode**: Enable debug mode with `toggleDebug()` to see detailed logging

## üöÄ Usage

The script is ready to use. Simply:

1. Load the script in your IDE
2. Start the auto-accept with `startAccept()`
3. Keep buttons will be automatically clicked along with Accept, Run, Apply, etc.

## üìä Analytics

Keep button clicks are tracked in:
- File analytics (if file info is available)
- Button type counts
- Time savings calculations
- Session data
